# Notes

## Implementation wise
1. For running each dataset, first we need to play with the preprocessing and tune the connectivity. 
2. In `run_pp.py`, find the comment that contains `** xxx **`. This is the place where user-item interactions are build.

3. move forward infrequent entries, shit. (on flight, 6-8)


## Paper writing wise

### Movation
1. graph's strong power on connection/similarity/correlation analysis
2. usually explicit friendship is not enough

### Experiments
1. Compare different connectivity.

## Problems
1. Some of the raters are mean. They don't have ratings above a certain number.
